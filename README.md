# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML and basic CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way to get in touch with me. The website consists of two main pages:

- **Home Page**: An introduction to who I am, highlighting my skills, experience, and a selection of my projects.
- **Contact Page**: A simple form that allows visitors to reach out to me directly.

Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any suggestions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio page
